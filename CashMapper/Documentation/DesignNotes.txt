@ScryptSnake 11.4.24 DESIGN NOTES FOR APPLICATION.
------------------------------------------------------------

DTOs / Data Entities:
- A question of whether 'lazy loading' should be used or 1:1 mapping of Records to DB table record. 
- Type Mapper needed for Dapper

Data Access Abstraction:
- Primary requirement:  to be database agnostic.
- A question of whether an abstracted IDatabase with delegates should be used for repositories. 
- Or simply build generic repository classes and inject a IDBConnection for CRUD ops.
- Another consideration is being SQL dialect agnostic. How do we achieve this? The ORMs abstract the DB usually. Dapper uses SQL statements tho. 
- To be ORM agnostic would be difficult.
